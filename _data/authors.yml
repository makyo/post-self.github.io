# Instructions:
# Create a top-level entry with a username for linking (starts with a letter,
# contains letters, numbers, and underscores). Within that entry, you will need
# a uri which must be http://post-self.io/about/contributors#<id> where <id>
# is the key for the top-level entry (this is for jekyll-feed, which needs to
# know how to link to your profile), a name for displaying, a bio (markdown is
# permitted), and an optional metadata list, which contains a list of objects.
#
# Supported metadata types are:
#   * twitter
#   * github
#   * website
#
# Keep this file ordered alphabetically by username. A suggestion, given the style in which branches are notated in the PS universe, would be to structure the name entry as "Proper Name#username" and mention instances in your bio.

    Emanate is an author, symbol-engineer, transhuman-hopeful, glow-aesthete, music-bender, and cosmalia curator in Seattle, WA. They are also trans, non-binary, kinky, poly, queer, postfurry, and a terrible punster. Their preferred pronouns are either [ve/ver/vis or they/them](http://pronoun.is/ve/ver?or=they “prounous”) They do not, despite the newly-acquired github account, actually work in tech or programming. :-}.

  bio: |
    Paul is a mathematician, graduate student, teacher, and fox, living in Chicago, Illinois. He loves to listen to overly intense music, distractedly ponder the universe's mysteries, explore, and spread the light of knowledge to everyone who can't get away fast enough. This instance, a relatively new fork tasked with exploring lorxus's general creative potential, will spend their time writing poetry and short fiction.

  bio: |
    Riismo is an engineer and ne'er-do-well from New England. He enjoys breaking things and (time permitting) fixing them, which is an approach that works more often than it ought to and at least is interesting when it doesn't. He's also a furry, and on most days a rather grumpy one.
